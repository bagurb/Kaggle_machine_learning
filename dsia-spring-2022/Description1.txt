In this study we use institutional data (acquired from several disjoint databases)
related to students enrolled in undergraduate courses of Polytechnic Institute of Por-
talegre, Portugal. The data refers to records of students enrolled between academic
years 2008/09–2018/2019 and from different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy,
design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service and technologies.

The data contains variables related to demographic factors (age at enrollment, gender,
marital status, nationality, address code, special needs) socio-economic factors (student-
worker, parent’s habilitations, parent’s professions, parent’s employment situation, stu-
dent grant, student’s debt) and student’s academic path (admission grade, retention years
at high school, order of choice for enrolled course, type of course at high school). We
limit the academic information to factors observable prior to registration, excluding
internal assessments after enrollment.
Each record was classiﬁed as Success, Relative Success and Failure, depending on the
time that the student took to obtain her degree. Success means that the student obtained
the degree in due time; Relative Success means that the student took until three extra years
to obtain the degree; Failure means that the student took more than three extra years to
obtain the degree or doesn’t obtain the degree at all.
